TUNIC LANGUAGE WRITER

*** CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT - ONLY WORKS A LITTLE BIT! ***

This package will let you write your own Tunic language sentences in MATLAB!

This package uses pre-existing dictionaries (in directory \Dictionaries) containing lists of words and accompanying IPA text. 
For any input of a given word, these lists are searched for a matching entry and the IPA returned.  The IPA string is parsed into syllables, and each syllable is plotted in turn.

Currently no support for multiple words.  In theory you can add words into the lexicon by appending the word and its corresponding IPA to the dictionaries.
